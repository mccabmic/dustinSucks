Blue Men
They are small, 6 inch tall, but fast and tough. They are hard to hit so they can take some damage. They can also do a LOT of damage when they crawl inside enemies’ armor or clothing.

Mob: Blue Men are actually a swarm of small individuals. For every 4 points of damage, they lose one defense die. For example, if they have a strength of 8, they would have 2d6 for defense.

Medusa
Scrawny lady with snakes for hair which helps her during combat. Just don’t look at her!
Glare: If a Medusa rolls a 12 when attacking then the target instantly gets turned into stone and Medusa wins! If Medusa uses Glare on Harry Potter on his first life, then Harry Potter comes back to life.
